hmmmmmm....<br />
i just made this whole update page and realized i don't know what to write about.<br />
well let's see what is on my mind right now...<br />
i can't wait to go to new york.<br />
and i can't wait to move in to my new apartment next month.<br />
and working six days a week isn't too bad, cuz my new job is the greatest job of all time.<br />
and that picture up there is a plant in front of dan's house in grand rapids that i changed the hue and saturation on.<br />
and when i look at it full size and zoom in i can see all these cool little spiderwebs and details.<br />
i wish i had more webspace.<br />
*sigh*<br />
it rained a lot today.<br />
and someone egged my car the other night but then it rained before i even saw it so it was a complete waste of their time.<br />
and eggs.<br />
losers.<br />
but there is still egg on my sideview mirror which is annoying.<br />
one day i will clean my car.<br />
that day is not today.<br />
but it will come.<br />
maybe in a week.<br />
or a month.<br />
probably sooner than a year...<br />
wow am i seriously rambling on about this crap?<br />
yes.<br />
yes i am.<br />
and that means that it is time for me to save this, and go get my laundry out of the dryer so i can wear my fancy new pants and shirt to work tomorow.<br />
wooo.<br />
<br />
p.s. - charlie needs to update his website really bad.  and so does chris.</p>
