weeeeee!<br />
apple picking is so cool you guys.<br />
ok so i don't know what to do.<br />
i am accepted to study abroad in australia BUT they cancelled the underwater photography program at JCU.<br />
F<br />
so if i went i wouldn't be doing what i wanted to do in the first place, plus i would be sitting around until the middle of february when their semester starts and i wouldn't get back until at least june 22nd, which would make it really hard to get a summer internship/job and it would be cutting it really close to take summer classes.
plus it is a lot of money.<br />
but it's australia.<br />
which would be freaking sweet.<br />
i don't know what to do...ahhhhhhh!!!!!!<br />>
oh well.<br />
in a few weeks i am gonna meet ali in san fracisco and then we are gonna drive all the way back here.<br />
badace.<br />
at least i have that to look forward to.<br />
ok i am gonna go drink some tea and write some stupid paper.</p>
