ok let's see...<br />
tuesday my brother and i headed down to ohio for a few days where i got paid to do a bunch of yardwork/painting/powerwashing for my grandparents because i suck at getting a job.<br />
we came home yesterday and after a dinner with our other grandma i headed out to south lyon in search of some wierdness/random times with megs.<br />
well we certainly succeeded in finding wierdness and randomness...<br />
...and awkwardness like you wouldn't believe.<br />
holy crap.<br />
so an hour or so after i got to south lyon, megs and i find ourselves driving past lansing to eaton rapids to a graduation party for someone i've never even heard of, and planning on spending the night somewhere out there.<br />
for some reason this all sounded like a great idea before we left.<br />
about halfway there i started thinking:<br />
"hmmm...you know, i've never even met this girl and i'm gonna show up at her graduation party at 1030 at night, this could be a bit awkward.."<br />
"and not only do i not know this girl, i don't know <i>anyone</i> who is going to be there...hmmmm........oh well!"<br />
so it was nice and wierd and awkward and uncomfortable.<br />
i tried giving out a few friendly hellos, but only received blank, confused stares in return.<br />
somehow i got convinced to leave that party with a bunch of people to head over to some other random eaton rapids party.<br />
also awkward.<br />
after a few beers i didn't feel too bad about it, and it turned out to be an ok time.<br />
after a while megs and i decided it would be best to head back to south lyon for the night.<br />
so just as i'm thinking this night can't get any more awkward, we roll in to her driveway at 230 or so only to find that her house was completely locked up and we had to bang on the door and ring the doorbell and call her mom to wake her up to let us in.<br />
yeah fun.<br />
after all this i'm thinking that i can finally just lay down, get some much needed sleep and this night will be over.<br />
i was wrong.<br />
you see, megs has a cat.<br />
and he is a jerk.<br />
and he likes to attack people all night while they are trying to sleep.<br />
gahhhhh!!<br />
so there you have it.<br />
i went in search of randomness and wierd times, and i guess i found it/them.<br />
well hey it was a whole lot better and more exciting and fun than sitting around doing nothing.<br />
i wouldn't have had it any other way.<br />
long live megs, the queen of creating awkward situations.<br />
(i hope that all made sense, i'm pretty tired, you see)</p>
