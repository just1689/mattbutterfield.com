<p class="posttext">Saturday was spent wandering around the city, looking for some interesting photos.  I didn't find very many though, so I'll just have to keep going back until I get back in my groove.  Later I watched the first Tim Burton Batman movie with Greg and Ben.  Awesome.  Yesterday was uneventful, as is today so far.  I am still looking for a job, and since I have been unable to ride my bike I have been spending a massive amount of time on the internet.  I just finished reading Peter Jurich's book online, entitled "Typing With One Hand."  It is basically a memoir about his life experiences growing up around Dearborn and Detroit, and I found it to be pretty entertaining and thoughtful.  He has posted the entire thing on the internet for free, and you can read it by going to <a href="http://www.typingwithonehand.com">www.typingwithonehand.com</a>.  I recommend checking it out...</p>
