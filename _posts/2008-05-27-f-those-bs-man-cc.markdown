<p style="text-align: left;">Today was memorial day.  It was a very nice day.  Unfortunately I spent it inside, still sick.  But I am slowly getting better.  By next weekend I should be able to starting going on bike rides again, which makes me happy.  I just had a huge slurpee.  That also made me happy.  It just started to rain outside really hard and I think it is going to start thundering soon, which is cool too.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">That is my trusty blue AA and NA focus.  The only car out there braving the rainy weather.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just for today guys, just for today...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ok I am late for watching the Pistons and Red Wings.  Later.</p>
