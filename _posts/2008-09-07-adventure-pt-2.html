I found a Best Western, took the greatest shower of my life and slept for about twelve hours.  I felt pretty awesome the next day, so I continued driving.  I gave Ali a call to let her know I was in Oregon, and she said she was there too!  I headed over to 101 and started driving up the coast to meet her and her friend Rachel.

After all that adventuring, I followed Ali up to Ashford, where I have been recovering (cleaning all my crap, getting my car fixed...etc.), and looking for a job in Seattle/Portland (if anyone knows of any, LET ME KNOW!!).  Stay tuned for some Mt. Rainier pictures!</p>
