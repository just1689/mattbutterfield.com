well it was a pretty good weekend.<br />
the paragon show was sweet.<br />
this has been one crazy month of shows for them.<br />
<br />
saturday i chilled at state all day.<br />
it turns out that state is maybe not the best place to be after a very upsetting football loss.<br />
whatever.<br />
it's not like a whole lot is happening at GV these days.<br />
lame.<br />
sauce.<br />
ahhhhh!<br />
ok time to do the hw i've been putting off all day.</p>
