<p class="posttext">Today was memorial day.  It was a very nice day.  Unfortunately I spent it inside, still sick.  But I am slowly getting better.  By next weekend I should be able to starting going on bike rides again, which makes me happy.  I just had a huge slurpee.  That also made me happy.  It just started to rain outside really hard and I think it is going to start thundering soon, which is cool too.</p>
