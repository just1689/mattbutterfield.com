<p class="posttext">Today's bike ride was fraught with peril!  Clouds of extremely annoying mosquitoes swarmed around me as I tried to do some exploring off the beaten (paved) path of my normal ride!  Then, my shoelace got caught in my gears!  Also, my camelback liner thing was leaking in my backpack!  Water was dangerously close to my camera!  To top if all off, as I was riding slowly and no-handed through this one part while taking my sunglasses off some old guy came out of nowhere and scared the crap out of me!  I almost veered off straight into some bushes!  Geez!</p>
