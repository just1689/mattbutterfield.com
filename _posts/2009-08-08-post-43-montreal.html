<p class="posttext">Well today is the rainiest (wait, rainiest is actually a word? sweet) day in history it seems, so I am sitting inside listening to Weird Era Cont by Deerhunter and finally finishing up these Montreal photos.  Montreal was a great time.  Possibly the greatest time.  We were there to hang out with Alex and his parents.  Also the MEG music festival was going on, so we went to some shows for that.  We saw some great DJ's, partied on a boat, explored the city, and had an overall bangin' time.  Montreal is an awesome place.  Everyone speaks French all the time, it definitely doesn't feel like Canada.  Super super cool place all the way.  Alright here are some pictures:</p>

<p class="posttext">Fun straws.  Our main source of sustenance for the 12 hour car trip there.  Perhaps a poor decision.</p>

<p class="posttext">After walking about a hundred miles we found the venue for the first night.  It was a tiny place with stone walls that was like a dungeon.  It was sooooo coooool!</p>

<p class="posttext">After her, Fischerspooner came out and did a DJ set with Lauren Flax who is from Detroit.  Well, half of Fischerspooner was DJing anyways...the other half was crawling around/laying catatonic on the floor of the stage so screwed up out of his mind he had to be taken out of the place by security.  Awesome.</p>

<p class="posttext">Alright I got yelled at for taking pictures on the boat too for some reason.  How can they throw a kickass party ON A BOAT and not expect people to take pictures?  Whatever, it was still the greatest thing in the world that night.</p>


<p class="posttext">Alright, so that was the famous Montreal trip last week.  Greatest time ever.  Don't pass up a chance to go there, it's really cool.  Now I am going to go find something to do.  Perhaps I will still go on a photo romp in Detroit even though it is pouring rain right now and will be for the forseeable future...or perhaps I won't.  I dunno man, whatever.  This post is so OVER.<br /><br />

P.S. though... I have also made huge advancements with all my audio/MIDI tinkering around.  Like, huuuuge advancements.  VST's in LMMS were a humble beginning.  LMMS is a primitive toy compared to what I am doing now.  I am now more powerful than you can possibly imagine!  Ok, I'm getting a little carried away...I'll do a post about it someday here.</p>
