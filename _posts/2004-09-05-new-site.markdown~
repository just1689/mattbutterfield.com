<p class="posttext">well, right now, its looking like deneb has seen better days.<br />
but don't fret, all is not lost.<br />
heres whats going on now:<br />
chris moylan and i have finished recording his solo project, minus drums and vocals.<br />
however, theres this thing, its called college. so we can't really finish those anytime soon.<br />
once those are done, the album will be released, and the next project will begin.<br />
yes, the next project is the infamous rabid moose addiction on fire.<br />
this will be guaranteed to blow your freakin mind man, so it will be worth the wait.<br />
(even though its been kinda in the works for about four years now...)<br />
after that is done (i'm thinking around christmas) well...anything can happen.<br />
probably another deneb album.<br />
but until we finish chris's album, nothing much is gonna be happening, seeing as we're all in college and whatnot.<br />
so i don't really know what i'm gonna do with this site, but i wanna do something, because having a website was pretty fun back in the good ol' days.<br />
i'm thinking of turning it into a site about my adventures in college or something along those lines.<br />
so keep checking back, because i'm definately gonna update it like, next weekend with some pics and stuff.</p>
