<p class="posttext">Well, I never made it on the adventure today.  I hate being sick so much.  I just want to feel better.  HOPEFULLY I will feel better tomorrow and I will be able to actually go do something.  I didn't want to get all complain-y already on only my third post, but I mean, I have been sick for almost the entire time I have been home after graduating like a month ago.  ENOUGH ALREADY.  Geez.  I have had to postpone so many bike rides.  So lame.  Ok that is all for now.  I am going to sleep for hopefully a very long time.  Goodbye.</p>
