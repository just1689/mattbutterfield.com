I bet you all thought that because today is Saturday, we would be taking a day off from mystery can.  Well you are in for a treat.  Here at mystery can, there is no such thing as a day off.  That's right, it's time for mystery can round 4.  Are you ready for this?  I bet you aren't.  Here we go anyways.

<p style="text-align: center;">I prepared some falafel for us to eat as the main course tonight with the new deep fryer that was a near disaster, but I pulled it together so mystery can could go on.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Chris slowly and cautiously opened his can, glaring at me after having to eat half a can of sauerkraut yesterday.</p>

Some may argue that today was not an exciting day for mystery can.  Let me tell you, as one of the people who actually has to eat this stuff, today was very exciting.  A wonderful, delicious meal is a nice treat.  However, tomorrow is the last day for vegan mystery can, and I have a feeling it won't be so easy for either of us...
