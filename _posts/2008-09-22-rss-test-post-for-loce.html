<p class="posttext">Woop woop.  I really need some new pictures on here.  However, I have been working a lot and of course I got sick so I've been dealing with that on top of everything else.  Blah blah blah complain complain.<br /><br />

Dan Hodges why on Earth would you go anywhere near the Salton Sea?  I have heard terrible things about that place.  If you want to camp in the desert just come to Burning Man next year...At least the ground there is solid enough to drive on, and it isn't covered in dead fish.  Although I do admire your adventurous spirit and intent, and I can't wait to hear the full story after seeing those pictures.  Ok that's all, this is really just a test post anyways, geez.</p>
