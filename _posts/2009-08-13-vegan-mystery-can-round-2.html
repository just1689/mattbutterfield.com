<p class="posttext">Time to find out!  I had some leftover chili to eat up so that is my main dish for today.  This means that I will probably just have to eat whatever is in the can by itself pretty much.  A risk one must take sometimes when playing mystery can.</p>

<p class="posttext">I actually wasn't sure about this, I couldn't remember if I had ever had beets.  Maybe they are good?</p>

<p class="posttext">It turned out to be pureed butternut squash or something.  I thought it would be disgusting but Chris actually kinda liked it.</p>

<p class="posttext">Chris gorged himself on it.  He wins this round I guess...damn!</p>





<p class="posttext">Whew.  Well I feel glad to get those beets out of the way.  Tune in tomorrow for vegan mystery can part 3!!!</p>
