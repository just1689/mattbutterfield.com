Sorry no pictures today, definitely will post some soon, I promise.  I've actually been pretty busy here since I've come in to Seattle.  Right now I am in a coffee shop on Capitol Hill (the coolest neighborhood, where I hope to live if I stay here) and they are blaring Nirvana.  How stereotypical right?

A few things happened today:

1.  I tried out riding the bus because trying to drive and park in Seattle is just terrible.  Turns out it was really easy, nice and fast, so that is a big plus.

2.  I put labels on 1200 coffee bags for 10 bucks and hour.  Woooo...!

3.  I had a little phone interview for a job which resulted in me adding a little "before and after" editing section to my main website, which I probably should have done a while ago anyways.  I don't know if I'll get the job, but at least it got me to do that and at least I finally heard back from someone.

4.  It was cloudy today.  Apparently Seattle is really, really nice in September.  I thought it rained every day here, but I have been in the Northwest for kind of a long time now and I haven't seen a drop of rain yet.  Actually, this was the first legitimate overcast day I've experienced.  I guess it actually does rain like every day starting in a month or so though, which I am ok with.

So that's a little update on my life.  I am staying with my brother's old friend Caleb Woods here in Capitol Hill.  I really like the area.  I hope something works out soon, I am getting sick of being all up in the air about everything and whatnot.  I'm starting to get a little dizzy from life.
