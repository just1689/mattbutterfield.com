if my life was a hallway, it would probably look something like this:

except maybe there would only be one door, and i guess it wouldn't really be so desolate and empty looking.<br />
but it is still kind of frustrating sometimes to not know where all these things are going.<br />
i mean don't get me wrong, it is a whole lot of exciting too (and i realize my life could be a billion times worse than it is), but sometimes i just stop and think:<br />
'what the hell is going on? and what if everything i am doing now turns out to be a complete waste of time?'<br />
needless to say, thinking this doesn't do a whole lot to get me motivated, and i think i need to worry less.<br />
but it just seems like i have to make a million decisions about my life every day, and i mean come on, am i really supposed to be able to predict what i am going to want to do a year from now, or even a few months from now?<br />
i don't even know if anyone really knows what i'm talking about here, but whatever.<br />
life is wierd, and a lot of people really annoy me. (don't worry, chances are if you read this you aren't one of those people)<br />
but i guess i just have to keep on going and see what happens.<br />
so yeah anyway, this past week has been pretty good, but i am actually really looking forward to heading home next week.<br />
i just need a break from schoolwork and whatnot, i'm really not a huge fan of this semester so far...<br />
this past weekend was pretty fun.<br />
thursday was good times with allison.<br />
friday was good times ice skating and yesterdogging.<br />
and last night was ok at dan's, even though i wasn't in that much of a partying mood for whatever reason...<br />
so i guess that's it for now, i have an early exam tomorow.<br />
i promise i'll get some better pics and updates on here soon, i have just been kinda drained lately.<br />
february remains hands down the crappiest month of the year, good thing it is also the shortest.<br />
the end.</p>
