Yes, the rumors you have heard are true.  Last year in November I moved to Columbus, Ohio, to become the best damn aerial survey camera operator in the world.  Who knew that getting a photography degree would (eventually) actually lead to a sweet job.  I never thought I would move to Ohio, but here I am.  Columbus is alright.  I won't lie, it's not my favorite place in the world, and I still hardly know anyone but hopefully that will change soon.  I at least live in a cool part of town, and the music scene is decent.  Been to a few shows, RJD2 rocking out to 800 people was the best so far.  

I also bought a new camera this week, which is great.  I've been needing a smaller, stealthier camera to take around with me so I can shoot more.  The Lumix DMC-LX3 is exactly what I needed to help document my continuing adventures.  I've been traveling a bit, and I plan on exploring the more interesting areas around here now that the weather is improving.  Expect more regular updating from me again now that I am more settled in here.  

I was walking through the park today and I saw an albino squirrel.  I have named him snowball.  I couldn't get very close otherwise I would have a much better picture:

That is all for today, it's been a long week.  I hope all of my billions of readers out there are doing well, particularly you, crazy Russian spammer who comments daily several times even though none of your comments show up because they are so obviously spam...  Anyway, spring is here, rejoice and whatnot.  Winter was cold.  Hooray.
