quick update:<br />
i miss grand rapids quite a bit.<br />
i wish i could have stayed longer.<br />
wednesday i went to the beach with laura and we hung out all day which was cool and fun.<br />
then thursday i hung out with little dan mostly at his cool house downtown.<br />
we tried to have a garage sale to raise money for his feeding the homeless thing, but we only made like 20 bucks.<br />
oh well.<br />
after that we chilled downtown doing his homeless thing at heartside park.<br />
i got a call somewhere in there that made me come home early :(<br />
but i'm pretty sure i have a new job.<br />
one that pays well and doesn't suck!<br />
more about that and more pictures from GR coming soon.<br />
i have to go to stupid bob evans for maybe one of my last times now...<br />
i have the house to myself this week! wooo!</p>
