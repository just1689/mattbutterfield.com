a few days ago, the video card on my computer went from making a moderately annoying noise some of the time, to making an unbearably annoying noise ALL the time.<br />
so i forced dan to come with me to best buy to get a new one, and i made him take pictures out the window as we drove.<br />
the top image is one of them.<br />
the bottom picture i took a few minutes ago.<br />
it is me, contemplating how to destroy this terribly annoying piece of technology that i have successfully replaced with newer, better, slightly less annoying technology.<br />
i don't think it would catch on fire too well, and even if it did, the fumes would probably leave me brain damaged.<br />
running it over with my car wouldn't do much, and wouldn't be too satisfying.<br />
maybe i will get a bat, and play baseball with it.<br />
i wish it was warm out.</p>
