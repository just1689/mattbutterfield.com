<p class="posttext">Alright ok I apologize for that last post.  Don't read it.  Seriously.  Ugh.

So I have pretty much finished the design here.  Let me know what you think so far.  It is simple, I know, but that is how I roll.  I basically wanted to make this look as close to my old site as possible, but slightly more functional and easy to read.  I might try to widen this column or something, I dunno.  Actually I think it might look a little too gray and depressing right now, but once I start posting bright color-y pictures it might be a little better.  We'll see.  I am just glad to have this up and running finally.  It has been a while since I have had a site to update on a regular basis, and I have really been missing it lately.  All I can say at this point is stay tuned.  This is way easier and more convenient for me to update than my last site so hopefully I will be posting here quite a bit.  Now I just need to start having some more adventures, and as long as this stupid sore throat goes away I will be going on a good one tomorrow.  Hooray!<br /><br />
Now here is a picture of a gigantic bug who was hanging out on my window the other day, followed by a picture of a bird who lives in a tree in our backyard, and a picture of Ringo the dog, livin' the life:</p>
