<p class="posttext">
wednesday night we left for arkansas.<br />
we got there around 2 or 3 the next afternoon<br />.
the game was at 10:30, followed by a press conference.<br />
i went to bed at 1 am.<br />
i had been up since 7 am wednesday morning.<br />
that is something like 42 hours.<br />
i saw three different dates on my watch before i got any sleep.<br />
then i did it all over again on the way back saturday/sunday.<br />
aside from the ridiculous time spent awake, it was really fun.<br />
and after all that driving, i'm really glad they actually won.<br />
oh and on the way back, we were in southern illinois at like 3:30am and some guy in a huge f-250 or something was barreling down the wrong side of the freeway at like 75 and almost killed us.<br />
crazy.<br />
unfortuanately i didn't have any time to go out and take pics on my own, so that's all for now.</p>
