Well...kinda.  It's actually much more than that.  Really I just finally got the VeSTige plugin working on Linux Multimedia Studio, which is awesome.  I can now download VST Instrument plugins, put them into piano rolls, play them with my computer keyboard, use LADSPA effects on them, basically do anything I want.  What I really want to do is get my synthesizer to work as a controller for this, but I have no idea how to do that...yet.  Sure this would all be super easy with expensive equipment and software, but figuring out how to do it yourself for free is much cooler.
