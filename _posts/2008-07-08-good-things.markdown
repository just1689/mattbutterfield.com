1.  I am making money.  The job is stupid, but it's easy and I am being paid.  Also, I will only be working there until mid-August because:

2.  I am officially going to Burning Man!  Why?  Becuase I feel like it, and it is going to be awesome, and I always need more excitement in my life which I'm sure will be provided.  Also, it is (sort of..kind of..) on the way to Washington, where I will be:

3.  living for like a month(?) while trying to get a job in Portland/Seattle/wherever I can which means that:

4.  it is likely that I will be moving somewhere that isn't crappy Michigan very soon.

Those four things are kind of interconnected, I guess.  Everything came together in a rush of impulsive decision making which culminated in me buying my Burning Man ticket.  Needless to say I am very excited.

More cool photos will be posted sometime soon.  I wish I had a camera that was easier to take on bike rides.  I went on a 65-mile ride to Ann Arbor and back on July 4th and saw lots of things I wanted to take pictures of.  Maybe I will do it again this weekend and bring my camera with me, even if it's really uncomfortable.  This blog needs more cool shit like the book depository on it.
