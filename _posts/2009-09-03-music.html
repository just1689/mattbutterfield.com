This is my room which is pretty much a nice little mini recording studio right now.  It would take a really, really long time to type out all the stuff I have done and programs I have gotten working since my last music related post, so I will just say these things:<br />
<br />
1.  I have a LOT of software synthesizers, including a ton of vintage synth emulators at my fingertips that I can play in real time by using my real life digital synthesizer as a MIDI controller, which is really really cool.<br />
<br />
2.  I am writing and recording music using my synth, a MIDI sequencer, software synths, vintage drum machine emulations, an MR-8, guitars, Ardour, and various other things.  I suspect this list will continue to rapidly grow.<br />
<br />
3.  I have learned a ton of stuff about synthesizers and recording music in general.  I have a new understanding of synthesizers, recording, and electronic music.  I finally now have the tools and basic knowledge that I need to properly record, mix and master audio.  Because of this, each song I start work on now sounds better than the last, and I am getting to the point where I will soon have a finished product that I am very happy with.<br />
<br />
4.  Right now I have a bunch of songs that are semi-finished.  As long as my computer stays alive for the next few weeks, I should have a 5 song EP (or whatever) type thing ready for downloading hopefully by the end of the month, and more material after that if all goes well.  I know my fan(s) (Alex, Ben, plus or minus 1 or 2 people) out there have been waiting a long time for this, and probably didn't believe me when I said that more music was on the way, since I've been saying it for a few years now with no actual results, but it's for real this time.  I've been pretty productive with this stuff since DEMF and MEG energized and motivated me to work on making electronic music again.  That's all for now.</p>
