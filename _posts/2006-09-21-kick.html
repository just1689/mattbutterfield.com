so i am sitting here at 2 in the morning with the new dj shadow album blaring in my headphones and it has some very good songs for times like this.<br />
i am probably seriously damaging my hearing right now, but i love it.<br />
and now it's a few minutes later and i am now listening to the new ben kweller cd, which is very different from previous mentioned album, but it's pretty good so far.<br />
ruckus is pretty cool, but does anyone know how to unprotect these files so i can make a freakin cd of them so i can take them in my car and rock out?<br />
because that is essential.<br />
on friday i am making a trip to state.<br />
it should be a fabulous adventure.<br />
i can only hope that it will be filled with much debouchery or whatever the hell that word is.<br />
i don't even know what that word means really, or how to spell it, but i like it and i don't feel like looking it up.<br />
those three photographs are all that i feel right now in this very moment.<br />
...or something like that.<br />
and i guess that is all for now.<br />
i wish i lived downtown.<br />
i want to go far away and never come back.<br />
but then come back after like a few months/years/decades.</p>
