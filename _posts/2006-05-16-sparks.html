<p class="posttext"><br />
it's really early and i can't sleep.<br />
it's been raining and like 45 degrees since thursday.<br />
it's tuesday.<br />
i don't know what's going on up there, but i hope it gets sunny again soon.<br />
i don't mind a rainy day or two, but this is getting ridiculous.<br />
how am i supposed to go on bikerides in the rain?<br />
oh yeah the other day we did sparklers.<br />
ok back to sleep.</p>
