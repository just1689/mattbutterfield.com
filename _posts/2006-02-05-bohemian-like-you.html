<p class="posttext">
on friday, after finishing my polaproblem for 4x5, i was sitting around wondering what the hell i was gonna do all weekend when i suddenly got the urge to get the hell out of here.<br />
now i get this urge all the freakin time, but this time i couldn't ignore it so within an hour i had packed up some supplies and gotten on the road.<br />
i wasn't too sure where i was going, but i knew i wasn't going to spend the weekend in allendale so i headed east.<br />
i was trying to call chris at state, but his phone wasn't on, so i gave nikki a call when i got there and chilled with her and julia in holden for a while.<br />
after we played a few games of catch phrase with a korean girl who barely spoke english, i realized that chris probably went home or something, so i needed a new plan.<br />
it was either go to central or u of m...after a few phone calls i settled on ann arbor and i was back on the road.<br />
i met charlie in ann arbor and we chilled in west quad.<br />
we threw back a few and then headed out.<br />
apparently i had picked a bad night to come, parties were either being broken up or being extremely lame, so most of our time was spent walking around while i called everyone i knew in my phone.<br />
eventually we ended up back in the room and we just went to bed.<br />
we didn't get up early enough to move my car out of the lot across the street, so i got a ticket.<br />
parking is stupid.<br />
most of saturday was spent watching a bunch of movies and arrested development because it was pouring rain outside and i was waiting for megs to get back from doing family stuff.<br />
she finally got back around 8 and i went over to her house to shower and whatnot.<br />
then we went to pizza house, drank shirley temples and froze our asses off walking around.<br />
people said they were gonna come over, but everyone backed out, so it was just me megs, and later, charlie.<br />
charlie showed up buzzing around 11 and helped me drink as we told her his facinating life story.<br />
he left around one and megs and i just talked until like 430 in the morning.<br />
good times.<br />
so today i woke up and drove back to allendale...<br />
and here i am, waiting to head out to a superbowl party.<br />
all in all, a pretty sweet weekend.<br />
the end.</p>
