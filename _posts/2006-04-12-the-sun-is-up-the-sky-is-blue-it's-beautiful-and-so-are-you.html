i have been extremely busy lately.<br />
seriously.<br />
i started printing today, and i decided to make huuuge 11x14 prints (because that's all that lakewood had left).<br />
so they're badass.<br />
also, yesterday was crazy.<br />
i had a job interview!!!!!!<br />
it went well i think, and i realllllllly hope i can get the job so i can stay here for the summer.<br />
like, i realllllly reallllllllllllly hope i can do it.<br />
really.<br />
after that ali and i made BADASS paragon shirts.<br />
they are badass.<br />
btw, the word 'badass' is coming back into mainstream usage.<br />
badass.<br />
sooo other than that, it has been pretty gorgeous outside.<br />
i went rollerblading the other day.<br />
fun.<br />
ok well, it's time for the bad news...<br />
i guess grand valley has finally caught on to the fact that i am way over my alotted upload space with this website's 350 or so large picture files.<br />
so they are only letting me get a few more on here before pictures stop loading.<br />
BUT good ol' charlie over at u of m is letting me use some of his gig of free space.<br />
so once we figure that out, i'll be back on track.<br />
until then, enjoy spring everyone, and remember, don't stress out about school so much.<br />
it's not healthy.<br />
more updates coming sooooooooon!</p>
