doesn't blow away in a dust storm out on the playa!  Yes, for those of you that don't know, tomorrow I am leaving for Burning Man, which will probably will be the craziest thing ever.  I am really excited for it!  There is going to be so much to see and do there.  At this point I feel like I am pretty much as prepared as I can be having never been to it before.

My next update will be from the road...I don't think I'll be able to get an update out from Black Rock City.  Afterwards, it's who knows...stay tuned.
