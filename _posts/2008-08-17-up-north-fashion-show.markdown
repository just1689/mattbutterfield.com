<p style="text-align: center;">Well Greg and I decided to go up north to Alex's one more time.  It was awesome!  The photographic highlight was clearly when we decided to have a fashion show with clothes we found in his grandparent's attic.  Awesome.   We also did a lot of dirtbiking which was badass because I rode a bigger, faster bike than I usually do.  Unfortunately, I took two nasty falls though.  One resulted in me landing on my FACE, and for the other one I slammed my head into the ground really hard.  It hurt a lot and still does, but at least I didn't break anything. Instead I just have a headache and a ton of bruises and scrapes.  I think every once in a while it is good to go out and do crazy things that are somewhat terrifying and leave you sore, dirty, and with a bunch of bruises and scrapes.  Without stuff like that, life would be pretty dull.  Am I right?</p>
