<p class="posttext">
my photojournalism professor gave us an assignment to spend two hours with someone to take some candid portraits of them.<br />
so i thought, hmmm...who do i want to spend two hours with that will be doing something intersting that will make cool pictures.<br />
of course, chris is always doing something crazy being an art major so i headed over to calder to watch her work on stuff for her metalworking class.<br />
so here are some pictures of that.</p>

this is an interesting semester because all my photo classes are digital.<br />
i am probably not gonna shoot a roll of film all semester.<br />
this is cool cuz i don't have to spend money on paper and film constantly.<br />
plus i can more easily put stuff on my site.<br />
cool.<br />
i'll put up some more stuff i have been doing soon.</p>
