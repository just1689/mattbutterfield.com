ahh don't you love being able to shoot handheld at f/22 and ISO 100?<br />
i know i do.<br />
so i went to the beach today.<br />
it was very windy, and very cold, so i am going to be very angry if i didn't meter for my 4x5 film right..<br />
man i wrote all this ranty stuff today cuz i was really pissed.<br />
but i'm not pissed anymore so i'm not gonna post it.<br />
<br />
yesterday was a very fun day, with lots of laughing and funness and secrets...shhh!!!!<br />
haha i'm glad we didn't get arrested, we were such badasses, never expected to do anything like that.<br />
if the girls win on wednesay i'm going to arkansas i guess.<br />
that'd be sweet, but i don't want to miss the paragon weekend here...<br />
i guess i just have to wait.<br />
i'm a professional.<br />
end entry.</p>
