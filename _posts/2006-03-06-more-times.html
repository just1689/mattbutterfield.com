i have reached a milestone...
and a MIND BOGGLING COINCIDENCE OF EPIC PROPORTIONS has occurred.
i am still trying to recover from it, and i'm not sure i would even believe it myself if i didn't have photographic evidence, even though i witnessed it with my own two eyes.
IF you think you can handle it...scroll down to reveal what it is...............

<p class="posttext">WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
yes, that's right.<br />
100,000 miles.<br />
and yes, for those of you who know what car i drive, the trip odometer was really at that number.<br />
for those of you who don't know...i drive a mazda...<br />
<br />
....yes, a mazda.....<h1>626!!!!</h1><br />
i told you this was an amazing occurrence.<br />
100,000 miles!!!  626.0 miles on the trip thingy!!!!!!!!<br />
wooooooo i was going nuts on the freeway.<br />
it was pretty much completely awesome.<br />
ok so maybe you - my dedicated website fans (i love you all) - aren't as excited as i am about this...<br />
but i thought it was pretty fuckin cool.<br />
so yeah.<br />
mk enough about that, let's move on to all the other important news in my life that you all care so much about.<br />
it is 'spring' break even though it is still cold as crap outside.<br />
but that doesn't matter, because it is finally NOT FEBRUARY anymore.<br />
so it is finally getting a little brighter, greener, and less depressing outside, the birds are back singing and it is a <i>tad</i> bit warmer too.<br />
this translates to me feeling much happier and motivated to do stuff.<br />
hooray!<br />
unfortunately, i woke up this morning unable to breath out my nose and with a terrible cough, sore throat and headache.<br />
my sickness is back with a vengeance.<br />
at least this happened while i was at home where i can get proper rest and nourishment.<br />
mmmm.....nourishment...<br />
and as much as i wanted to go to virginia with alex and ben, it's probably good that i didn't, i would've been a pretty big downer.<br />
anyway, BEFORE i got sick, spring break was going pretty well.<br />
yesterday i got a bunch of my stuff organized and cleaned, hung out with grams, and watched some of the oscars with chris.<br />
saturday i chilled with alex, greg and chris until megan's birthday dinner at TGI Friday's.<br />
it was pretty fun, except the wait was ridiculously long.<br />
boooo.....<br />
after friday's we watched sixteen candles or something, haha and we were completely obnoxious throughout the whole thing...sorry about that girls.<br />
then there was friday.<br />
woa boy....friday...<br />
fridays are always the best days.<br />
first i drove home, got the shot of 100,000 and 626.0, then headed out to shoot the <A HREF="http://www.paragonrock.net">paragon</A> concert.<br />
it was by far the best show these guys have ever played.<br />
everyone, including me, was shocked.<br />
after the show we went to a party with a whole bunch of the 'cool' DC kids.<br />
and you know what?<br />
for the partying reputation these kids had in high school...it was about the lamest party i've ever been to...<br />
but that's ok, all that mattered was the show and how good it was.</p>
