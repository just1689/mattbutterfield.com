title: strangest thing i saw

<p class="posttext">

on saturday the paper had an article about ice invading the shoreline of lake st. claire.<br />
it happened to be right by alex's house in grosse point, so i grabbed my camera and went over to check it out:</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20070312_002.jpg" width="483px" height="725px"/><p class="posttext">apparently there are some crazy currents caused by winds which in turn caused all this to happen somehow...<br />
i don't really get it, but it was cool and the ice was really brittle and fun to play around on.<br />
after that i toted alex and his cousin austen around detroit on a craaaazy photo hunt.<br />
I was hunting for HDR images.<br />
HDR stands for high dynamic range, which means it is a photo that has much more detail in overly dark and bright areas than a normal photo.<br />
it is kind of hard to understand at first but...<br />
you can make them in photoshop by combining a bunch of differently exposed images of the same scene into one image, so instead of getting something that looks like this:</p>
<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20070312_003.jpg" width="800px" height="533px"/><p class="posttext">
<br />you get this:</p>
<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20070312_004.jpg" width="800px" height="533px"/><p class="posttext">this is made from 12 different images, some overexposed, some underexposed to bring out allllll the detail possible.<br />
as you can see there is a lot more detail overall, especially in the dark areas.<br />
i think it is kind of cool, but they take a lot of time and work to make.<br />
i would rather just go nuts and take a million photos of everything and not have to carry around a tripod and do a whole crapload of post-processing.<br />
plus, even though this is how our eyes see the scene, it takes a lot of work to get them to look normal, and not like a drawing or something.<br />
it's pretty weird.<br />
so anyways, here are some other ones i have been working on:</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20070312_006.jpg" width="533px" height="800px"/><p class="posttext">i think this one looks like a big ice monster tearing apart the concrete as he climbs out of the water getting ready to rampage through the city.</p>
<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20070312_007.jpg" width="532px" height="800px"/><p class="posttext">..i'm really in to ice lately.  but i am glad it is melting finally.</p>
<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20070312_008.jpg" width="533px" height="800px"/><p class="posttext">grand rapids. made from seventeen different exposures.
oh yeah, there was also a paragon show on thursday at the worst venue ever.<br />
i got one cool image though, luckily i brought my dad's flash:</p>

and that is it for pictures.<br />
random thoughts:<br />
1.  last week was spring break, and it was probably the best spring break ever.<br />
all i did was sleep, sit around, eat, and...sleep.<br />
hopefully i am now energized enough to finish out the semester without jumping off a bridge.<br />
2.  i am really in to the newest 'of montreal' album.<br />
it keeps growing on me and i can't stop listening to it (alex doesn't like it, but he doesn't know anything).<br />
3.  i hope i hear back from one of the internships i applied for soon.<br />
4.  if anyone knows anyone who needs a room in ann arbor for the summer, talk to me or charlie collier.<br />
charlie needs to be set free from his house so we can go on crazy adventures.<br />
5.  daylight savings time started today.<br />
i love daylight savings time, what a great invention!<br />
only bad part about it is that it is three in the morning and i am just now getting tired.<br />
but that will pass soon.<br />
now i am going to go to bed, which i should have done a long time ago, because i have a lot to do tomorrow.<br />
