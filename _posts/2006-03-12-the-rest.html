ok so saturday i head out to ann arbor and megs and i go to cottage inn for some food.<br />
i got this pepperoni and wild mushroom thing that was sooooooooo good.<br />
after that we headed back to her place and got pulp fiction because she has NEVER SEEN IT OMG!!<br />
she also gave me a stuffed stingray from tennesee which is freakin awesome.<br />
then it was off to see charlie for the HSC reunion.<br />
well it turns out that the reunion part only lasted like 2.5 hours because charlie and i went into the basement of some house that was having a party and the rest of HSC got bored or something and left.<br />
but before that we did manage to hang out at the bubble tea place and play ultimate frisbee with some random kids???<br />
i dunno.<br />
the rest of the night was spent walking allllll over the freakin place and not accomplishing much.<br />
then today charlie and i went out taking pictures for my crazy color class.<br />
it was awesome, we found some sweet crap.<br />
which brings me to my point: i wish i lived in ann arbor, because, among many other things, it has some really sweet crap.<br />
which for some reason brings me to another topic:  the summer.<br />
what the hell am i gonna do all summer?<br />
i DO NOT want to spend it sitting on my ass in my house working some job and hating my life.<br />
so if anyone has any ideas to help me spend as little time in dearborn as possible, just let me know.<br />
just spending a week there was enough to make me go freakin crazy.<br />
well i guess that's it.<br />
another spring break under my belt.<br />
big deal.<br />
ps - it was SOOO FREAKING NICE OUT TODAY HOLY CRAPXOR.</p>
