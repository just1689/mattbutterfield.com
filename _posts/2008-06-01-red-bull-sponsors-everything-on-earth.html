<p class="posttext">Well today was pretty cool.  I was excited because they were practicing for the Red Bull Air Race downtown, and you could go watch for free.  Unfortunately, even though we got down there like two hours before it was supposed to be over, we only got to see one plane fly through the course for like two minutes before they deflated the huge pylon thingies.  Laame.  So after that we headed over to the MGM Grand where I lost three dollars.  woooo...  Then we ate at Greektown which was interesting.  After that we watched the Pistons lose.  Now I am sitting on Alex's couch and I'm tired.  weeee.  Whatever I was just happy to be out of my house finally after being sick for so long.  Hooray!  I think I am going on a Detroit photo hunt tomorrow, so hopefully I will post some pictures from that.</p>
