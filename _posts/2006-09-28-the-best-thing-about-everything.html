it was a glorious day today.<br />
i had to end it with some pictures of its glorious ending.<br />
the french kicks make me happy.<br />
why is everyone so sure of their own beliefs?<br />
and why would anyone ever try to force them on anyone else?<br />
i can understand having a discussion about them and trying to convince someone that what you believe in is sensible, but to go out of your way to tell someone that what they believe is wrong, and to try to make other people believe what you believe, is insane, ignorant, stupid and annoying.</p>
