my hands and clothes are flithy and black from my roof.<br />
tonight <i>was</i> going to be really boring.<br />
but i just couldn't take a night of sitting around doing nothing.<br />
so i walked out in the backyard and noticed the gorgeous night sky.<br />
mmmmm<br />
it was time to get the camera out:</p>

it was a really still and quiet and nice night so it was really really cool to just lay out there waiting for exposures to finish watching the clouds go by (you can't see many stars here).<br />
in other news, i work at bob evans.....wooo.....<br />
whatever, a job is a job...<br />
...gahhh i should have just stayed in GR, i could be at the beach right now with people i miss.</p>
