<p class="posttext">Today Chris and I made cookies.  Chris also set up a webcam in our apartment.  You can watch us and/or our cats by going here: <a href="www.mattbutterfield.com:8080">www.mattbutterfield.com:8080</a>.  I know it's kind of creepy, and the video quality is terrible, but we're working on that.<br /><br />

I've been playing around with Linux a lot lately with lots of help from Chris.  I'm running the latest openSUSE if anyone is curious.  I also read a book by Linus Torvalds who originally created Linux.  It has all been pretty interesting, and once I get a few things straightened out I probably won't ever have to use 'windoze' again.  My laptop still sucks balls though...<br /><br />

I have also been working on some music again, thanks to some of the wonderful free software you can run on Linux, which is nice.  I'm trying not to become a Linux snob, but once you start using it and you learn about it's advantages and the philosophy behind it, it's kind of hard not to become one, because it is pretty cool.<br /><br />

I have been cooking up a storm lately.  I suddenly love to cook things all the time.  My favorites so far are chicken chili, turkey burgers, these really good potatoes, and chicken parmesan.  I think I'm going to try a roasted tomato basil soup tomorrow.  Mmmm....  Cooking saves me money and helps me eat healthier more well-rounded meals.  It is also fun to learn new things and it's a great way to pass some time.<br /><br />

Ummm...other than that I am pretty much sitting around right now.  I'm not too sure what to do with myself really, but I'm working on it.  Alex has given me one month to decide on something.  I have a few ideas, but I'm just not sure yet.  Anyone else have ideas?<br /><br />

I want it to be warm outside.  Has this winter seemed especially cold for anyone else?  Brrr...<br /><br />
