friday i went home.<br />
we gathered together all of HSC and had cigars and it was a good time.<br />
saturday alex and charlie came on a photo hunt with me around detroit with my 4x5 camera.<br />
thanks guys, that's always fun.<br />
then i rushed back here to get in the color lab with ali so i can get to work on my color stuff.<br />
whew.<br />
frustration.<br />
then sunday i only got 3 negatives developed because the effing resource room effed up my effing dark room time so i only had an hour to work.<br />
grrrrrrr.<br />
i hope that guy calls about my summer job soon.<br />
i want to know what i'm gonna be doing with my summer.<br />
aside from being crazy busy, life is pretty good.<br />
now i am off to the land of nod.<br />
google has some wierd words of the day.</p>
