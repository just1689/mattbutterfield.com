<p class="posttext">All of a sudden it is like 90 degrees with a million percent humidity outside.  But whatever, I was out in it on my bike.  There is nothing better than coming inside from a tiring bike ride in that weather, all sweaty and hot, and downing a few glasses of ice water in the cool, dark basement.  Ahhhh...Â  I don't know why more people don't ride bikes.  Bikes are awesome.  I was thinking that when I was riding home from Chris's house earlier tonight as the cool night air was sweeping over me and a crescent moon was rising through some clouds in the sky  that was just barely still noticeably lit from the sun that set maybe 40 minutes earlier.  So nice.  I also had the song "It Beats 4 U" by My Morning Jacket stuck in my head.  That song has been stuck in my head a lot lately.  Good song.  I had it blaring out my car windows last night when we were driving around and honking and acting like idiots (because the Wings won the Stanley Cup or something).<br /><br />

I am going to go ride dirt bikes again this weekend up north.  As much as I love regular biking, it is also sometimes pretty fun when your bike has a motor on it and big tires and you ride it through a bunch of mud and dirt and stuff.  I will probably post some pictures, Sunday-ish.</p>
