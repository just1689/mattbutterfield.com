The other day my mom asked me if I could transfer some cassette tapes to CDs for her. Since I clearly have nothing else to do with my life right now I said 'sure.'  I brought the tapes up to my room and brought out my old four track tape player, which I soon discovered would no longer play tapes due to some 'repairs' I had to carry out a few weeks ago in order to get a headphone jack out that had broken off inside.  'No big deal' I thought, 'I'll just go grab my stereo from the other room, the tape player probably sounds better on that anyways.'  Not the case.  For some reason the sound was alternating between being really muffled and really warbley.  I was starting to get mildly frustrated, but I just went down and got my dad's old expensive tape deck from his crazy stereo system, figuring that it would sound the best and definately not break down.  Sure enough, I brought it up and after recording the first song from a tape and using some noise reduction in the software I was using, I had a really great sounding recording.  Then I went to record one more song and the tape deck started to act really weird, like it was constantly trying to switch the tape direction.  After messing around with it for an hour I concluded that it was completely fucking broken.  I could not find any other tape decks in the house, so I asked Chris if I could borrow the one he had in his basement.  Well, last night I went to get it and this morning I hooked it all up, thinking that there was no way in hell it was not going to work.  Of course, it doesn't work.  None of the buttons seem to do anything at all.  Now I have four broken tape decks and a big stack of Christmas music tapes on my desk that may never be heard again.  I have two theories about this:

1.  Every tape deck I come into contact with for the rest of my life will instantly break.

2.  Tape decks just don't work anymore.  It's 2008, and all tape decks have reached their expiration dates.  Nothing on a tape will ever be heard again.

I'm pretty sure one of these is true.  Or maybe Chris will come over and show me some secret trick about his tape deck that I don't know about.  We will find out.  Anyways, if you have a tape deck, I need to borrow it.  So I can break it.

I need to get out of here.
