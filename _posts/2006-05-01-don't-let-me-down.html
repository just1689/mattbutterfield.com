<br />
OK so.<br />
thursday was the last day of school!<br />
yay!<br />
summer!<br />
as usual it is off to a crazy start.<br /><br />
<i>a story of my mission to have a good time on my last night at school and also make it home by 7am to drive up to my brother's graduation with my parents:</i><br />
so i got out of my last final thursday at 6, and i think i have like 3 hours to kill before the damone concert, so that's when i planned on packing.<br />
unfortunately, doors were at 5:30<br />
crap!<br />
so ali, charlie and i rush down there and are JUST in time.<br />
they played a rockin good show, and we got to meet them and talk with them after.<br />
charlie asked dustin, the drummer, if they wanted to hang out after, so he gave him his phone number!<br />
so we're all like woa charlie has dustin from damone's phone number!<br />
cool beans.<br />
after damone played, this INSANE band called valient thor played.<br />
i don't even know how to describe them, possibly the craziest rock show i've ever seen.<br />
ever.<br />
the lead singer was jim morrison and the guy from system of a down...on acid..combined into one person.<br />
the guy climbed to the ceiling!!!<br />
while singing!!<br />
and wore really tight pants!!<br />
and had a huge gut!!<br />
but took his shirt off anyways!!<br />
wow they were nuts.<br />
"we are from space, and you are from michigan!!"<br />
alright so after that, we hung out GR for a while.<br />
around 930 we called up dustin and he was all up for goin to a party.<br />
so we picked up him and mike, and headed out to a party...with the drummer and guitar player from damone in the back seat!!<br />
crazy times.<br />
all i will say about the ensuing events is that a LOT of alcohol was consumed.<br />
unfortunately, i was DDing because i had to drive home later that night.<br />
dustin was passed out in ali's lap from the absinthe on the way back.<br />
but we just dropped them off at the hotel then drove allll the way back to campus to start packing me up to go home... <br />
keep in mind: i have packed absolutely nothing, it's 3:30 in the morning, i have to drop ali off at her apartment, and somehow be home at 7 when my parents are planinng on leaving to drive ten hours up to michigan tech.<br />
my roommates must think i am the craziest person.<br />
i threw everything into trash bags and somehow fit it all in my car in about an hour.<br />
it wasn't long before charlie puked and crashed on my mattress, so i just left him there.<br />
then i drove ali back to her apartment, said goodbye, and got on the road.<br />
it's quarter to 5.<br />
driving home i was so tired, it was probably the scariest experience of my life.<br />
but i made it and pulled up my driveway at 7:15am.<br />
whew.<br />
all that, just to get right back in the car and drive for ten more hours to the almost the northermost point of the UP.<br />
weeeeee.<br />
somehow i pulled it all off and i'm not dead.<br />
michigan tech was fun.<br />
my brother graduated with a degree in chemical engineering and is going to denver soon to start working for haliburton.<br />
yay for giant corrupt oil companies who hire my brother and pay him lots of money!<br />
after the graduation ceremony we went to this river and went fishing.<br />
it was pretty cool, then we walked on the beach and saw these crazy old mining ruins which were crazy.<br />
and wow that was a lot.<br />
now i am back and i still have a lot of unpacking to do.<br />
so i will end it there i guess.<br />
summer is off to a crazy start.<br />
i wonder what else is gonna happen.</p>
