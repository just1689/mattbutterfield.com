<p class="posttext">deneb150: dude<br />
deneb150: ok<br />
deneb150: i had this crazy dream last night<br />
deneb150: it was you and me at first<br />
deneb150: we were trying to like break into this senator's house or something<br />
deneb150: to take pictures of stuff?<br />
deneb150: i dunno<br />
deneb150: anyway<br />
Arcticsungt: yes!<br />
deneb150: for some reason we had to like, bury these futuristic space helmet things in his back yard<br />
deneb150: in some corner<br />
deneb150: so as we were working on those<br />
Arcticsungt: what...?<br />
deneb150: like pounding them into the ground<br />
Arcticsungt: go on<br />
deneb150: ...for whatever reason<br />
deneb150: we notice a security gaurd has come up behind us<br />
deneb150: so we freak out, bust open the fence and start running<br />
deneb150: only the security gaurd is faster than we are<br />
deneb150: but we have a secret weapon!<br />
deneb150: somehow, and i realize this makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER<br />
deneb150: we can text each other on our phone the number 1<br />
deneb150: and our cell phones will make us invisible <br />
deneb150: so you do it first<br />
deneb150: and you disappear<br />
deneb150: and the gaurd is slightly confused<br />
deneb150: but he figures it's just becuase it is dark out<br />
deneb150: so he starts chasing after just me<br />
deneb150: and i'm trying to text you the number 1 so i disappear  <br />
deneb150: and i finally get it to go through<br />
deneb150: ...but nothing happens@<br />
deneb150: !<br />
Arcticsungt: this sounds like the greatest disney movie ever<br />
deneb150: lol<br />
Arcticsungt: do you get caught!?<br />
deneb150: so he's all running really fast at me<br />
deneb150: like way faster than i can run<br />
deneb150: and all of a sudden i run behind this curtain<br />
deneb150: at this point i wake up again, for like 20 seconds, then fall right back into a dream state<br />
deneb150: and behind this curtain is DC's auditorium<br />
deneb150: and there are people just chillin around, kinda like stage crew before a dress rehearsal or something<br />
deneb150: and chris is there<br />
deneb150: he is part of the cast, and he is playing guitar next to some other kid with a guitar<br />
Arcticsungt: hhahaha, yes<br />
deneb150: except he is also kurt cobain at the same time<br />
deneb150: so he's standing there next to this kid<br />
deneb150: giving him like all this wisdom and advice about life and playing the guitar<br />
deneb150: like he is some strung out genius<br />
deneb150: and during all this he is also shooting up with heroin <br />
deneb150: and he keeps getting more and more distant, making less and less clear sense<br />
deneb150: eventually he passes out<br />
deneb150: and he has overdosed<br />
deneb150: and he's dead<br />
deneb150: then i woke up <br />
deneb150: and i was like<br />
deneb150: holy shit<br />
deneb150: wtf<br />
Arcticsungt: chris/kurt cobain dies in your dream<br />
Arcticsungt: awesome.<br />
deneb150: yeah<br />
Arcticsungt: thats some pretty intense shit<br />
deneb150: yeah<br />
Arcticsungt: im more interested in this invisible thing<br />
deneb150: i know!<br />
deneb150: like<br />
deneb150: we couldn't do it at the same time<br />
deneb150: we forgot to test that!<br />
Arcticsungt: hahaha<br />
deneb150: how could we be so overconfident<br />
deneb150: that's what i was thinking in the dream<br />
Arcticsungt: that new technology lends itself to that<br />
