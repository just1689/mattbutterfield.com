deneb150: dude
deneb150: ok
deneb150: i had this fucking crazy dream last night
deneb150: it was you and me at first
deneb150: we were trying to like break into this senator's house or something
deneb150: to take pictures of stuff?
deneb150: i dunno
deneb150: anyways
Arcticsungt: yes!
deneb150: for some reason we had to like, bury these futuristic space helmet things in his back yard
deneb150: in some corner
deneb150: so as we were working on those
Arcticsungt: what...?
deneb150: like pounding them into the ground
Arcticsungt: go on
deneb150: ...for whatever the fuck reason
deneb150: we notice a security gaurd has come up behind us
deneb150: so we freak out, bust open the fence and start running
deneb150: only the security gaurd is faster than we are
deneb150: but we have a secret weapon!
deneb150: somehow, and i realize this makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER
deneb150: we can text each other on our phone the number 1
deneb150: and out cell phones will make us invisible 
deneb150: our
deneb150: so you do it first
deneb150: and you disappear
deneb150: and the gaurd is slightly confused
deneb150: but he figures it's just becuase it is dark out
deneb150: so he starts chasing after just me
deneb150: and i'm trying to text you the number 1 so i disappear  
deneb150: and i finally get it to go through
deneb150: ...but nothing happens@
deneb150: !
Arcticsungt: this sounds like the greatest disney movie ever
deneb150: lol
Arcticsungt: do you get caught!?
deneb150: so he's all running really fast at me
deneb150: like way faster than i can run
deneb150: and all of a sudden i run behind this curtain
deneb150: at this point i wake up again, for like 20 seconds, then fall right back into a dream state
deneb150: and behind this curtain is DC's auditorium
deneb150: and there are people just chillin around, kinda like stage crew before a dress rehearsal or something
deneb150: and chris is there
deneb150: he is part of the cast, and he is playing guitar next to some other kid with a guitar
Arcticsungt: hhahaha, yes
deneb150: except he is also kurt cobain at the same time
deneb150: so he's standing there next to this kid
deneb150: giving him like all this wisdom and advice about life and playing the guitar
deneb150: like he is some strung out genius
deneb150: and during all this he is also shooting up with heroin 
deneb150: and he keeps getting more and more distant, making less and less clear sense
deneb150: eventually he passes out
deneb150: and he has overdosed
deneb150: and he's dead
deneb150: then i woke up 
deneb150: and i was like
deneb150: holy motherfucking shit
deneb150: what the fuck
Arcticsungt: chris/kurt cobain dies in your dream
Arcticsungt: awesome.
deneb150: yeah
Arcticsungt: thats some pretty intense shit
deneb150: yeah
Arcticsungt: im more interested in this invisible thing
deneb150: i know!
deneb150: like
deneb150: we couldn't do it at the same time
deneb150: we forgot to test that!
Arcticsungt: hahaha
deneb150: how could we be so overconfident
deneb150: that's what i was thinking in the dream
Arcticsungt: that new technology lends itself to that
