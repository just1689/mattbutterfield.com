well, right now, its looking like deneb has seen better days.  
but don't fret, all is not lost.  
heres whats going on now:  
chris moylan and i have finished recording his solo project, minus drums and vocals.  
however, theres this thing, its called college. so we can't really finish those anytime soon.  
once those are done, the album will be released, and the next project will begin.  
yes, the next project is the infamous rabid moose addiction on fire.  
this will be guaranteed to blow your freakin mind man, so it will be worth the wait.  
(even though its been kinda in the works for about four years now...)  
after that is done (i'm thinking around christmas) well...anything can happen.  
probably another deneb album.  
but until we finish chris's album, nothing much is gonna be happening, seeing as we're all in college and whatnot.  
so i don't really know what i'm gonna do with this site, but i wanna do something, because having a website was pretty fun back in the good ol' days.  
i'm thinking of turning it into a site about my adventures in college or something along those lines.  
so keep checking back, because i'm definately gonna update it like, next weekend with some pics and stuff.
