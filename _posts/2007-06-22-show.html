what?  you thought that i wasn't gonna shoot concerts for a while since i'm not around paragon anymore?<br />
one of the great things about living in this house is that up on the fifth floor there are a bunch of berklee music students who all kick ass at various instruments.<br />
so last night i decided to go check out a show a few of them were playing in the north end.<br />
it was a good time.<br />
here are some pictures:</p>

after the show we all headed up to the roof and hung out, and people played more music which was great.<br />
it was a good night.<br />

one of these days im going to go on a proper boston photo hunt.<br />
so maybe i will do that and post more photos this weekend or something.</p>
