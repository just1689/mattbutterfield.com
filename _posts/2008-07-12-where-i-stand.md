So tonigHOLY FUCK A BIG BLACK SPIDER JUST CRAWLED  OUT FROM <em>UNDER</em> MY LAPTOP AND RAN DOWN MY DESK THEN TRIED TO HIDE UNDER THE CARPET BUT I GOT IT OUT AND THEN CHASED IT ACROSS THE ROOM WITH MY SHOE AND KILLED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Anyways ladies and gents, every day is an adventure.  I found the broken window you see in the photo above today at an abandoned hotel in Dearborn.  There was something very strange about it.  It was so unstable that it was somehow making audible sounds.  I mean you could stand there and actually hear the glass struggling to stay up and together as gravity pulled slowly and relentlessly on it.  At any point it could have completely collapsed into a billion pieces all over the ground.  In fact, it probably already has.

So now I will quote, if I may, the late Hunter S. Thompson:

"The Edge... there is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over. The others-the living-are those who pushed their control as far as they felt they could handle it, and then pulled back, or slowed down, or did whatever they had to when it came time to choose between now and later."

<p style="text-align: center;">And today I devised a way to bring my camera <em>and</em> my water thing on bike rides.  It is absolutely genius!  Weee!  Now the internets can reap the benefits.  Reap them!:</p>
