For whatever reason we decided to have a fire and drink at least one bottle of wine every night last week in Greg's backyard.  By the fourth day we were sick of buying wood, so we made our fire out of a starter log, a log from the previous day, and a bunch of particle board that my dad was throwing away.  It turns out that we weren't supposed to burn the particle board because it had a bunch of weird glue and chemicals in it that smelled awful when burning.  But that was ok because the fire had become an experimental abstract expressive art project:

Eventually I went a little crazy and put a few too many pieces of the particle board on the fire, causing it to sort of smother out, sending assloads of toxic smoke into the air...we used a hose to put it out.  The next day though we had a real fire with lots of real wood and a barbecue with hot dogs and veggie burgers and we made s'mores with marshmallows to make up for it.  Mmmmm....

In other news, today I went to see the Detroit Symphony play some Philip Glass music while some wildlife photography by Frans Lanting was projected onto three huge screens behind them.  It was sweet.  Afterwards they had an exhibit of real live bats in the lobby.  Then I ate a hamburger at the Detroit Beer Co.  A good day.  But now I have a headache, so I am going to go relax and go to bed.  Goodnight.
