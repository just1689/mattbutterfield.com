my ass hurts.<br />
on saturday, the clouds finally cleared after a week of terrible weather.<br />
so greg and i made a 31 mile trek to ann arbor on our bikes.<br />
it was quite a ride, needless to say.<br />
we were so exhausted by the time we got there from the wind in our face and the hills that we had to call megan to pick us up.<br />
thanks megan! :)<br />
other than that nothing too exciting has happened the past few days that i can think of, so that's all for now.</p>
