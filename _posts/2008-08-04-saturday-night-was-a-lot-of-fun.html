My apologies to anyone who tried to access my site yesterday.  Chris was moving his server and it was down most of the day as a result.  I'm sorry, I should have warned you.  Everything appears to be fine now though.  Whew.  I am getting really frustrated with my job.  I don't think my boss even has my phone number but he keeps telling me that he'll 'call me back' every time I call him.  Also, why do pictures look different (less contrast-y, and slightly desaturated) when viewed in Mozilla as opposed to when I am editing them in Photoshop?  It's kind of annoying.<br /><br />

The past week has been pretty good.  I went to the West Side for a bit, hung out with people, went to the beach and went on a nice bike ride along Lake Michigan.  Saturday was a Paragon show in East Lansing.  Greg played drums pretty hard despite having a torn up elbow due to a biking accident earlier in the day.  Hardcore!  Now I am back at home.  Alex spent two grand on a bike so hopefully this week will be filled with many bike rides.  Oh and Chris and I were born 22 years ago on Wednesday.  Wooo.  Alright.</p>
