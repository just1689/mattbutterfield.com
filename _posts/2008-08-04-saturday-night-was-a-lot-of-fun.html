two flashes went off here.  weird.


My apologies to anyone who tried to access my site yesterday.  Chris was moving his server and it was down most of the day as a result.  I'm sorry, I should have warned you.  Everything appears to be fine now though.  Whew.  I am getting really frustrated with my job.  I don't think my boss even has my phone number but he keeps telling me that he'll 'call me back' every time I call him.  Also, why do pictures look different (less contrast-y, and slightly desaturated) when viewed in Mozilla as opposed to when I am editing them in Photoshop?  It's kind of annoying.  

The past week has been pretty good.  I went to the West Side for a bit, hung out with people, went to the beach and went on a nice bike ride along Lake Michigan.  Saturday was a Paragon show in East Lansing.  Greg played drums pretty hard despite having a torn up elbow due to a biking accident earlier in the day.  Hardcore!  Now I am back at home.  Alex spent two grand on a bike so hopefully this week will be filled with many bike rides.  Oh and Chris and I were born 22 years ago on Wednesday.  Wooo.  Alright.
