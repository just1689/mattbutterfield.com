yesterday i woke up, looked outside, then called megs and we went to the beach.<br />
it's a long walk to the beach at rosy mound, lots of stairs up to this huge ridge that looks down on the lake.<br />
let me tell you, as soon as we got over that ridge, the most frigid lake michigan wind just started blasting us.<br />
i didn't have gloves so i couldn't have my hands out to take pictures for more than about a minute at a time before i had to retreat them to my pockets so they didn't fall off or something it was so cold.<br />
but the beach was beautiful as usual, and those are just a few of the pictures i got.<br />
speaking of pictures, i just got an email from the lanthorn (our paper) and i got a job!<br />
wow my first job as a photographer.<br />
even though the pay will be complete shit, it should be a lot of fun.<br />
anyway after the beach we hung out at the basketball game which was kinda loud and crazy.<br />
twinkie the kid, a giant bumblebee and some other wierd people were there.<br />
i have no idea.<br />
after that it was off to the pub for kristin's birthday, then back to campus west for the party.<br />
it was fun, even though i didn't know many people..i think i made some new friends thanks to raspberry vodka and turkish silvers.<br />
so that was saturday.<br />
friday i went ice skating then hung out at aaron's trailer.<br />
never do warm shots with no chaser.<br />
we watched platoon and i kept going mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMM.....<br />
it was a fun time.<br />
so this semester is going to be busy as hell.<br />
two photography classes plus three math-y classes plus a job is going to be an insane amount of work.<br />
but i think this semester is going to be a good one.<br />
ok i have to finish writing a letter and applying for studying abroad.<br />
my brother turns 22 today.<br />
wierd.</p>
