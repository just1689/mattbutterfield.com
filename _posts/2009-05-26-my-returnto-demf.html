Decided I could not pass up DEMF this year, since I have been needing to do something actually fun and interesting for a while now, and Chris is finally over his fear of AIDS stickers.  I'm definitely glad I returned!  It was a lot of fun this year, and I'm glad to see the fest headed in a good direction.  Well then, here are some pictures!</p>

<p class="posttext">Then on Sunday I decided to go meet up with my Burning Man friend Lauren who was in town at a breakcore barbeque!  And I got a sweet Robocop Detroit T-shirt for 5 bucks!  Totally awesome.</p>


<p class="posttext">Great weekend.  
Sooooo anyone want to give me a job in Chicago or something so I can get out of here?  East Lansing is ugh.  Camping trip to Sleeping Bear Dunes next month though!  Can't wait!  I have like a 20 person campsite reserved and there are 7 of us going, so if anyone has a tent and wants to go June 5-7 just let me know.</p>
