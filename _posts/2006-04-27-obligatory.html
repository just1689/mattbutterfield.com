goodbye crappy apartment.<br />
today i go home, if my car gets out of the shop in time.<br />
it looks like i didn't get the job so i think i'm home for the summer.<br />
what a perfect ending to this semester.<br />
one big letdown after another.<br />
i had high hopes for this semester.<br />
especially since last winter semester was amazing, and fall was pretty good too.<br />
it turns out that it sucked.<br />
that's all i have to say about it.<br />
it sucked...<br />
...ok, it could have been a lot worse, but i still didn't like how things turned out at all.<br />
most of the time i found myself wishing i had never come to school here.<br />
but i'm not gonna sit here and complain about it, what good does that do.<br />
on the bright side, charlie is on his way over here right now and we are going to the damone concert with lisa and ali later.<br />
yayyyyyy<br />
oh and yesterday i went with ali and lisa to get their tatoos.<br />
then we watched muholland drive.<br />
...<br />
wow.<br />
i think everyone should watch that film.<br />
you will be so confused.</p>
