so yeah, this is the third time i am attemping to update this, so sorry if i'm a little sparse here.<br />
anyway, i have been shooting a lot of film for my final color project, it is going to be three triptychs (sets of three images), so nine prints all together.<br />
each triptych is going to be three abstract images from a building downtown, arranged in a way that is pleasing to me visually in terms of both color and composition.<br />
and i could go on and on, but after trying to update this three times i don't feel like typing it all out again.<br />
so here is an example i threw together (a.k.a. two hours of RAW and photoshop editing) from some digital shots i did today:</p>
