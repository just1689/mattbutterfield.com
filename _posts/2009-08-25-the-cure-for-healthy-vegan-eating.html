<p class="posttext">After weeks of intense kitchen experimentation we are pleased to announce that we have discovered a cure that reverses the effects of eating healthy vegan food.  This isn't just for vegans, anyone can accomplish this task by following these simple instructions.  Step 1: Cut potatoes and load up with salt and pepper.</p>

<p class="posttext">Step three: allow to cool, and eat.  Apparently these are known as "potato chips."  I think they might prove to be very popular someday.  This image shows as many as we could have ready at a time because they were immediately consumed by our kitchenologists once they were cool enough to eat.</p>
