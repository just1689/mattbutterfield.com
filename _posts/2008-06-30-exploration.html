<p class="posttext">On Saturday, Peter picked Alex and me up to go on an urban exploring adventure.  The Detroit Book Depository Building apparently started off as a post office, then was turned in to the book depository for Detroit Public Schools, then for some reason it was left completely abandoned.  It has not been in use for many years, but it was not left empty.  Exploring it was one of the craziest photo hunts I have ever been on:</p>

<p class="posttext">The whole building is surrounded by barbed wire fences, which aren't really too effective since there is a gaping hole outside of these loading docks, where we got in.</p>

<p class="posttext">A taste of the random things that are scattered on the ground outside.</p>

<p class="posttext">Boilers.</p>

<p class="posttext">I'm a wheel.</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20080630_005.jpg" alt=" " width="725px" height="483px"/>
<p class="posttext">The first floor.  Very dark.  Very wet.  Very gross.  We did not explore it much.</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20080630_006.jpg" alt=" " width="725px" height="483px"/>
<p class="posttext">The second floor is much more interesting.  This is one of many huge piles of books.</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20080630_007.jpg" alt=" " width="725px" height="483px"/>
<p class="posttext">This is what the floor looked like.  It seemed to be made out of thousands wood blocks sitting on end.  Very strange.</p>

<p class="posttext">Yarn.</p>

<p class="posttext">Looking down the north-facing side of the second floor.</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20080630_011.jpg" alt=" " width="725px" height="483px"/>
<p class="posttext">These things were everywhere.  I'm guessing they were stacked at some point as shelves for all the crap that is now on the floor.</p>

<p class="posttext">I'm sure kids at some school in Detroit need some chalk right now.  Here it is.</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20080630_015.jpg" alt=" " width="725px" height="483px"/>
<p class="posttext">On the left you can see the <a href="http://www.forgottendetroit.com/mcs/index.html">Michigan Central Train Station</A>.  It is also huge and abandoned.  I might go in there someday.</p>

<p class="posttext">Piles of more random things.</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20080630_018.jpg" alt=" " width="387px" height="580px"/>
<p class="posttext">A bathroom.</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20080630_019.jpg" alt=" " width="725px" height="483px"/>
<p class="posttext">In here we saw a steaming pile of fresh feces.  A sign that we were not alone...  A few minutes later Peter was admiring what looked like a dwelling made from all kinds of stuff piled together.  He then saw it move.  A few minutes later a homeless dude came out.  Kinda creepy, but he didn't bother us at all, and we were glad to leave him alone.</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20080630_020.jpg" alt=" " width="725px" height="483px"/>
<p class="posttext">We couldn't figure out what this was.</p>

<p class="posttext">A room.</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20080630_027.jpg" alt=" " width="725px" height="483px"/>
<p class="posttext">The third floor.  I guess there had been a fire on this floor, because the ground was mostly a "soil" of burned books.  Here, part of the roof had collapsed under the weight of the trees growing on it.  Very reassuring.</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20080630_028.jpg" alt=" " width="725px" height="483px"/>
<p class="posttext">The third floor also has the most graffiti.  There is some really interesting stuff.</p>

<p class="posttext">Seriously, are people setting off bombs or something up here?</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20080630_041.jpg" alt=" " width="725px" height="483px"/>
<p class="posttext">Trees growing with the Detroit skyline in the background.</p>

<img src="http://images.mattbutterfield.com/20080630_042.jpg" alt=" " width="725px" height="483px"/>
<p class="posttext">To the right, you can see the tops of the trees that are growing on the third floor.  They had previously been on top of another thing like this, which fell into the third floor.  This one looks like it's going to go soon as well.</p>

<p class="posttext">We couldn't go in the basement as it was completely flooded with about three feet of water.<br /><br />


So my first real urban exploring adventure was a complete success.  If you ever plan on doing it, remember to bring a flashlight, and don't wear new shoes.
