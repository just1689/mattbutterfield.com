the other day i was at kensington and i saw this cool rainbow around the sun^<br />
yeah i haven't updated in a while, but there are two reasons for that:<br />
1.  i haven't done anything exciting lately until like this past weekend.<br />
2.  all i do is work.<br />
but it's all good.<br />
i now have more than enough money for my trip, my temp job at iTek is almost over, and i only have to work at bob evans one more time (hooray!).<br />
friday i saw pirates, which was kinda 'ehhhhh...'<br />
saturday i went to south lyon, saw my cousin's cool house, went to kensington with megs, went to ben's house, then went to ann arbor for some hookah.<br />
yesterday i worked, then went to mary's birthday party and swam in her pool and sat around a fire.<br />
yay for fun weekends.<br />
now i am tired.<br />
paragon played in mt. clemens last wednesday, and we saw some cool cars before the show:</p>
