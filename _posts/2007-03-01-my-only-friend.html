well i made it through another february.<br />
guhuhhh....february..<br />
what a terrible month to be alive.<br />
today it rained for the first time in a while.<br />
it was the grossest day ever.<br />
but it is a necessary step on the way to spring, so i welcome it.<br />
once you get to march, you know everything will be OK.<br />
i am glad it is march.<br />
i am glad that it is spring break.<br />
so incredibly glad.<br />
i was being beaten down by the MAN big time.<br />
stupid MAN.<br />
now i can recover and come back stronger than ever, and kick the MAN in the face!<br />
i can't wait to kick the MAN in the face.<br />
hopefully i don't get sick the minute i get home like every other spring break.<br />
everything sticks like a broken record.</p>
